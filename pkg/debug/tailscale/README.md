Private WireGuardÂ® networks made easy

## Overview

This repository contains all the open source Tailscale code.
It currently includes the Linux client.

The Linux client is currently `cmd/relaynode`, but will
soon be replaced by `cmd/tailscaled`.

## Using

We serve packages for a variety of distros at
https://pkgs.tailscale.com .

## Building

```
go install tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale{,d}
```

We only support the latest Go release and any Go beta or release
candidate builds (currently Go 1.13.x or Go 1.14) in module mode. It
might work in earlier Go versions or in GOPATH mode, but we're making
no effort to keep those working.

## Bugs

Please file any issues about this code or the hosted service on
[the issue tracker](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues).
